Here is a detailed solution and code that meets the requirements:

**Solution**

1. We will use the `ftplib` library to connect to the FTP server and monitor the `wp-content/questions` folder for new or updated `.csv` files.
2. We will use the `pandas` library to read and write `.csv` files.
3. We will use the `llama` library to interact with the Llama 7B model.
4. We will use a scheduling library (`schedule`) to monitor the FTP server in real-time.

**Code**

Create a new file named `question_answerer.py` with the following content:
```python
import os
import ftplib
import pandas as pd
from llama import Llama
import schedule
import time

# FTP settings
FTP_HOST = 'ftp.malachairising.com'
FTP_USER = 'freelancer@burgerkingclaim.com'
FTP_PASSWORD = 'Freelancer2024@900AM'
FTP_PORT = 21

# WordPress settings
WP_CONTENT_FOLDER = '/wp-content/'
QUESTIONS_FOLDER = 'questions/'
ANSWERS_FOLDER = 'answers/'

# Llama settings
LLAMA_MODEL = 'llama-7b'

# Connect to FTP server
ftp = ftplib.FTP(FTP_HOST)
ftp.login(user=FTP_USER, passwd=FTP_PASSWORD)

def get_questions():
    # Get list of question files
    question_files = []
    ftp.cwd(WP_CONTENT_FOLDER + QUESTIONS_FOLDER)
    for file in ftp.nlst():
        if file.startswith('question-') and file.endswith('.csv'):
            question_files.append(file)
    return question_files

def answer_question(question_file):
    # Download question file
    ftp.retrbinary('RETR'+ WP_CONTENT_FOLDER + QUESTIONS_FOLDER + question_file, open(question_file, 'wb').write)

    # Read question file
    questions_df = pd.read_csv(question_file, skiprows=1)  # Skip header row

    # Answer questions
    answers = []
    for index, row in questions_df.iterrows():
        if row['STATUS']!= 'completed':
            answer = Llama(LLAMA_MODEL).answer(row['QUESTION'])
            answers.append(answer)

    # Create answer file
    answer_file = question_file.replace('question-', 'answer-')
    answer_df = pd.DataFrame({'ID': questions_df['ID'], 'ANSWER': answers, 'STATUS': ['answered'] * len(answers)})
    answer_df.to_csv(answer_file, index=False)

    # Upload answer file
    ftp.storbinary('STOR'+ WP_CONTENT_FOLDER + ANSWERS_FOLDER + answer_file, open(answer_file, 'rb'))

    # Update question file
    questions_df['STATUS'] = 'completed'
    questions_df.to_csv(question_file, index=False)

def monitor_questions():
    question_files = get_questions()
    for question_file in question_files:
        answer_question(question_file)

def main():
    schedule.every(1).minutes.do(monitor_questions)  # Monitor every 1 minute
    while True:
        schedule.run_pending()
        time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
**Explanation**

1. The script connects to the FTP server and sets up the necessary directories and file names.
2. The `get_questions` function retrieves the list of question files from the `wp-content/questions` folder.
3. The `answer_question` function downloads a question file, reads it, answers the questions using the Llama 7B model, creates an answer file, and uploads it to the `wp-content/answers` folder.
4. The `monitor_questions` function monitors the `wp-content/questions` folder for new or updated question files and calls the `answer_question` function for each file.
5. The `main` function schedules the `monitor_questions` function to run every 1 minute.

**Note**

* Make sure to install the required libraries by running `pip install ftplib pandas llama schedule`.
* This script assumes that the Llama 7B model is installed and configured on your local machine.
* This script is a basic implementation and may need to be modified to fit your specific requirements.
