Create an original script/program that does the following:
1. Monitor a question folder in a WordPress website "wp-content/questions" for new or updated .csv files containing rows of questions. question-001.csv, question-002.csv, question-003.csv, etc.
2. Answer each question using a locally hosted llm (llama, mistral, qwen, etc)
3. Save the answers to a different answer folder on the same Wordpress website "wp-content/answers"
4. Ensure that questions that have been answered are not answered again. For example, update a column in the question-###.csv files as "answered" or "done"
